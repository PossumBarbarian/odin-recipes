    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This fried catfish recipe is a classic Southern dish traditionally served with buttermilk hush puppies and buttermilk coleslaw.</p>
        <p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Buttermilk</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
                <li>Catfish</li>
                <li>Cornmeal</li>
                <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
                <li>Old Bay Seasoning</li>
                <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix buttermilk, water, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour mixture into a flat pan large enough to hold fillets. Arrange fillets in a single layer in the pan, turning to coat each side. Set aside to marinate.</li>
                <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, and seafood seasoning in a 2-gallon resealable plastic bag. Add fillets to the bag, a few at a time, and tumble gently until evenly coated.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Fry fillets in hot oil until crisp and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Work in batches to avoid overcrowding, so fillets have room to brown properly. Drain on paper towels.</li>
            </ol>
